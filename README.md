# ovh_api
Tool to interact with OVH API

update_ipv4.sh is a script to update IPv4 record of ovh domain zone (tired of trying to make dynhost work...). You first need to create a token with get and put permission on https://eu.api.ovh.com/createToken/ and update the variables with your credentials and zone details

update_ipv6.sh is a script to update IPv6 record of ovh domain zone. You first need to create a token with get and put permission on https://eu.api.ovh.com/createToken/ and update the variables with your credentials and zone details
